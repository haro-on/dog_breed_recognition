## Project Overview:
In this project, I have applied the skills to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images to give the same purpose of this website <a href='https://www.bing.com/visualsearch/Microsoft/WhatDog'> WhatDog <a/> created by Microsoft.
I have used Keras library to build a convolutional neural network to recognize dog breeds from images. Given an image of a dog, the model will identify the canineâ€™s breed. 
More feature: If you supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed. 


## dataset:
The data consists of 8351 dog images. The images are sorted into 133 directories, each directory contains only images of a single dog breed.
