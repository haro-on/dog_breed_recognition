# Dog Breed Recognition
 
## Project Overview:
The purpose of this project is to create a deep learning model that can identify a dog breed if given a photo or image as input. The project involves Image Processing using a Convolutional Neural Network along with a transfer learning model called "Resnet50" to accelerating the Training Process. Given an image of the dog, the pipeline will classify the dog breed in the image out of 133 possible classes of dogs. This project aims to give a similar purpose to this website: <a href=' https://www.bing.com/visualsearch/Microsoft/WhatDog'> WhatDog <a/> that is created by Microsoft.


## Dataset:
The data consists of 8351 dog images. The images are sorted into 133 directories, each directory contains only images of a single dog breed.
